# LMR Rules Anchor

## Version 1.7.6

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. Pre-Game Options (Locked at Game Start)

The following options may be enabled before the game begins and remain
locked for the duration of the game:

-   Team Play\
-   Double Dice\
-   Kill Rolls\
-   Fast Track

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9.1 Team Play (Optional)

If enabled, players are assigned to equally sized teams.

Victory Condition: - A team wins when all members of that team have
finished all Pegs.

Teammate Interaction: - A Peg may legally Kill a teammate's Peg.\
- Killing a teammate's Peg does not grant a Banked Die.\
- If killing a teammate is the only Legal Move for a Die, that move must
be taken.

Delegation: - When a turn owner has finished all Pegs, Pending Dice are
delegated to eligible teammates. - Dice are delegated one at a time. - A
Dead Die is forfeited only when no Pending Dice have Legal Moves.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9.2 Double Dice (Optional)

If enabled, two Dice are rolled at the start of each Turn.

-   Each Die becomes a Pending Die.\
-   Dice are resolved one at a time.\
-   Dead Dice are not forfeited while another Pending Die has a Legal
    Move.\
-   Auto-Pass forfeits remaining Pending Dice when none have Legal
    Moves.

Banked Dice Interaction: - Rolling a 1 grants exactly one Banked Die.\
- Rolling a 6 grants exactly one Banked Die.\
- If Kill Rolls are enabled, each qualifying capturing Move grants
exactly one Banked Die.\
- Double Dice does not multiply Banked Dice awards.

Bank Rolls: - The number of Dice rolled in a Bank Roll must equal the
number of Banked Dice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9.3 Kill Rolls (Optional)

If enabled, a player banks exactly one Banked Die for each Move that
captures one opponent Peg.

Qualifying Move: - A Move in which a Peg lands on an opponent's Peg and
sends it to Base under standard Kill rules. - A Move can capture only
one Peg. - A Move that captures an opponent's Peg grants exactly one
Banked Die. - A Move that captures a teammate's Peg grants no Banked
Die. - A Move that captures no Peg grants no Banked Die.

Banked Dice earned from capturing Moves accumulate during the Turn and
follow standard Banked Die and Bank Roll rules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 9.4 Fast Track (Optional)

If enabled: - Each player begins the game with one Peg on H3. - That Peg
is immediately Finished. - That Peg may not move and may not be
Killed. - Remaining Pegs begin in Base.

Fast Track alters only initial placement and does not modify other
rules.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Anchor Alignment Note

This Anchor mirrors Rules Authority v1.7.6, including the move-based
Kill Roll formalization (one Banked Die per capturing Move; teammate
exclusion retained).
