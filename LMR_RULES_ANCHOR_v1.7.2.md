\## Setup / Components



\- Board includes: Base, Track, Arms, Corners, Points, One Spots, Center Spot, Home

\- Dice are six-sided

\- Each Player has exactly 4 Pegs

\- Lower player counts may use boards with more Arms than active Players

\- Optional rules (locked at game start):

&nbsp; - Team Play

&nbsp; - Double Dice

&nbsp; - Kill Rolls

&nbsp; - Fast Track



---



\## Board Concepts (Quick Reference)



\- A Peg is always in exactly one location: Base, Track Spot, Center Spot, or Home Spot

\- Movement is always clockwise on the Track unless explicitly stated

\- Dice are resolved one Die at a time

\- Dice resolution order is chosen by the resolving Player

\- Each Die is resolved independently

\- If a Die has no Legal Moves, it is forfeited

\- If only one Legal Move exists for a Die at the time it is resolved, that move is forced



---



\## Track Entry



\- From Base:

&nbsp; - Roll of \*\*1\*\* allows entry to the Player’s \*\*One Spot\*\*

&nbsp; - Roll of \*\*6\*\* allows entry to the Player’s \*\*Point\*\*

\- Own Pegs block entry

\- Normal Kill rules apply on entry



---



\## Center Rules



\### Center Entry

\- Only from a Point

\- Only on a roll of \*\*1\*\*



\### Center Exit

\- Only on a roll of \*\*1\*\*

\- On exit, a Peg may move to \*\*any Point\*\* on the board

\- Exit is illegal if the destination Point is occupied by the moving Player’s own Peg

\- If the destination Point is occupied by any other Player’s Peg, that Peg is killed



\### Center Constraints

\- Only one Peg may occupy the Center Spot

\- If Center exit is the only Legal Move for a Die, it is forced

\- Entering or exiting the Center applies normal Kill rules



---



\## Home Rules



\- Each Arm has a final Track Spot preceding Home

\- That Spot is a normal Track Spot for all non-owning Players

\- For the owning Player:

&nbsp; - The Track terminates after that Spot

&nbsp; - Home entry may occur \*\*without stopping\*\* on the final Track Spot

&nbsp; - Exact count is required

&nbsp; - Own Pegs block Home entry

&nbsp; - If movement would continue past the final Track Spot, the only legal continuation is into Home



\- Home Spots fill in order: \*\*H3 → H2 → H1 → H0\*\*

\- A Peg is finished when it reaches the \*\*highest available Home Spot\*\*

\- Finished Pegs may not be moved again



---



\## Kills



\- Landing on another Player’s Peg causes a Kill

\- The Killed Peg is returned immediately to Base

\- Forced Kills must be taken

\- Kills are permitted on the Track and in the Center Spot

\- Kills are not permitted in Base or Home

\- If Kill Rolls are enabled:

&nbsp; - Killing an opponent grants an Extra Roll

&nbsp; - Killing a teammate does not



---



\## Dice / Turn Structure



\- Dice may be supplied externally (console / engine)

\- All Dice from a roll must be resolved or forfeited before rolling Extra Rolls

\- Extra Rolls are banked and resolved after current Dice

\- Turn ends when all Dice (including banked Extra Rolls) are resolved or forfeited



---



\## Team Play (Optional)



\- Teams are fixed before the game starts

\- Dice, not Turns, are distributed



\### Finishing in Team Play

\- When a Player finishes all Pegs:

&nbsp; - All unresolved Dice for that Turn are distributed to teammates with Legal Moves

&nbsp; - On future Turns, the finished Player continues rolling and distributing Dice

&nbsp; - If no teammate has a Legal Move for a Die, that Die is forfeited



---



\## End of Game



\- \*\*Individual Play:\*\* Game ends immediately when a Player finishes all Pegs

\- \*\*Team Play:\*\* Game ends when all Players on a Team finish all Pegs

\- Finishing order does not affect victory

\- Finishing order may be recorded for summary or rematch purposes
