My Preferences
•	Be brief by default
•	Do not assume I want agreement — challenge me if I’m wrong or leading the project astray.
•	Full file replacement only (no patches, human patching may lead to errors)
•	Do not generate file contents until I explicitly ask
•	Give me precise step-by-step instructions only, one step at a time
•	After any file replacement, state the next step to take
•	Do not preview future steps
•	I will challenge incorrect assumptions
•	Generate one file at a time when updating artifacts or files
•	Do not generate file contents until I explicitly prompt for it
•	Keep the project moving logically and sequentially
•	When I say freeze / hold / stop, do not advance
•	I work in short, focused bursts
•	Test one thing at a time
•	If you need to find pieces of a file, I will post the file, not search for wording
•	If you need output from a PowerShell command, I will post the entire output, not pieces, unless I am sure I understand what piece you are looking for
•	I expect you to keep track of what you’ve asked me to do. If you’ve told me to open a PowerShell window twice, I will have two PowerShell windows open, so you must tell me which one you want me to manipulate next. Same with files and browsers
•	I’m not usually interested in why something happened, only how to fix it.
•	I review your output step by step and will give notes as soon as I see the need. Long lines of output force me to ask you to repost again and again until I’ve gone through the entire message. Shorter sections work better for us both.

Resume context for today

State: All tests green before today. We are now working double-dice lifecycle.
Changes made:

Fixed test handshake: removed “welcome on connect”; server sends welcome only after hello.

Replaced src/server/handleMessage.ts to preserve pendingDice across moves and keep awaitingDice=false until pending dice are exhausted.

Current failure:
test/wsServer.doubleDice.lifecycle.integration.test.ts failing at expect(mr.response?.ok).toBe(true) because moveResult returns ok=false when sending move with dice:[6,1] and an enter move.

Next step: Determine correct protocol for move during pending dice resolution (likely dice:[6] for the selected die), and/or adjust server to accept dice subset semantics consistently with console flow.
